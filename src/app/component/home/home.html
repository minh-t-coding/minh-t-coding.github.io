                Hi! My name's <code>Minh Nguyen</code>, and I'm a software engineer currently based
                in Tucson, Arizona. I graduated in May 2020 from the University of Arizona with a
                Bachelor's in <code>Computer Engineering</code> and minors in Computer Science and
                Mathematics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have <code>over two years</code> of professional experience as a backend software
                engineer, having worked at PROS Holdings and now a part-time AI company validating
                large language model outputs. My professional background is primarily in backend,
                but I also have hands-on experience in frontend and automation from internships,
                bootcamps, and side projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm comfortable working with a wide variety of languages and frameworks, including
                <code>Java</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>TypeScript</code>,
                <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Angular</code>, and
                <code>Cucumber</code>, and I love learning new technologies and expanding my skill
                set.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy game development, which gives me a creative outlet to
                explore system design, implementation, and problem solving. I'm passionate about
                collaboration and coming together to make cool things!
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not at the keyboard, you can catch me noodling around on my guitar or
                catching a flick at my local movie theater. I also love exploring new restaurants,
                trying different foods, and seeing what craft beers my local breweries are cooking
                up.
            </p>
